                <h3>A-level Qualification</h3>

                <p> The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level, more commonly known as the GCE A Level, is a
                    school leaving qualification offered by secondary schools, sixth form colleges and further education
                    colleges in the United Kingdom, some Commonwealth countries, and at many international schools
                    around the world. In Scotland, the qualification is offered as an alternative to the more commonly
                    taken Highers.

                    The qualification was first introduced in 1951 to replace the Higher Schools Certificate, and final
                    examinations are normally taken in England and Wales at the end of Year 13 after two years of
                    classroom study, traditionally referred to as the sixth form.
                    Due to British colonial influence, many education systems around the world are modeled on the
                    British system, but the number of countries still offering A Levels is diminishing. The most recent
                    example of the move away from the British is Hong Kong, which recently replaced the Hong Kong A
                    Level with an entirely new Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education, while also shortening the
                    duration of schooling from 13 years, per the British model, to 12 years and lengthening
                    undergraduate education from three years to four years moving it closer to the U.S. model.
                    Some countries, such as Singapore, offer a customized version of the Cambridge International GCE O
                    and A Level as the exclusive national school examinations. International versions of British school
                    awards are discussed in more detail in the accompanying article of the current issue.<br><br>
                    Since its emergence on the horizon of the education <b>My School</b> has produced outstanding
                    students who have been successful in various walk of life. In the ‘A’ level’s we cater
                    to our own students and first preference is given to them. Very limited and selective
                    number of external students are given admission only if they come up to our
                    expectations.

                    What makes My School different from other Institutions is that it does not look for
                    quantity but to provide quality education. The fee structure is also minimal, the
                    facilities provided is as good as other ‘A’ level institution and even better.

                    The unique feature of My School is that we have students studying from the Nursery to
                    ‘A’ levels on one campus which gives the students a continuity of 15 years, helping them
                    grow from toddlers to mature young adults.</p>
